# Burrito-Time

https://infinite-atoll-82397.herokuapp.com/

Burrito Time is a full-stack app that tracks your burrito consumption (with Pusheen as your mascot - hover over him for a burst of "awwwwwwww"). You can choose from premade burrito options, or build your own. 

## Built With ##
* Node.js
* Express
* MySQL/SQL/MySQL.js
* Handlebars
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Bootstrap

## Summary ##

This app has three main components: 

* Eat a burrito: The buttons on the left are the premade burritos you can choose to devour. Once a burrito is devoured, it moves to the right side of the screen and becomes inactive.
* Devoured burritos: A list of disabled buttons that represent burritos you've devoured. 
* Add a burrito: Add a burrito of your own to the list of burrito options.


## Roadmap ##
Eventually would like to add a way to prevent duplicate burritos from being created and setting a limit for how many burritos can be available at one time.
